<p> In 1913, Congressman Alejo Labrador initiated the move to put up a vocational school in the province. The provincial government donated an eleven hectare farm where the school stands now, lending it the colloquial name of the Iba Farm School. A first two-story school building was constructed in R.M.M.S.A.T (R.M.P.C) school grounds (Old Site). The first school administrators were Americans. In 1918, the first batch of graduates emerged from the school. School Year 1917-1918 saw the first batch of graduates, all 19 boys were coming from various towns of the province </p>
